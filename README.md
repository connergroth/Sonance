# Sonance 🎵
A powerful music recommendation engine that integrates Spotify, Last.fm, and Albumoftheyear.org to provide personalized recommendations for songs, albums, and artists.

## ✨ Features
- Personalized Music Recommendations – Uses listening history, trending music, and collaborative filtering to suggest songs & albums.  
- Spotify & Last.fm Integration – Fetches listening data from both platforms for hybrid recommendation models.  
- Redis Caching – Stores frequently accessed data for faster responses.  
- PostgreSQL Database – Persists user interactions, recommendations, and metadata.  
- Music Compatibility Scores – Calculates similarity between users based on listening history.  
- Track & Album Ratings – Integrates Albumoftheyear.org (AOTY) for critic/user scores to prioritize highly-rated music.  
- Real-Time Updates – Fetches & processes data dynamically to reflect user preferences.  

##🛠 Roadmap & Future Improvements

✅ Enhance caching strategy for better performance  
🔜 Build a frontend using React or Next.js  
🔜 Integrate user preferences & manual ratings into recommendations
